Strategy - Multi-Provider Notification System
Objective
Implement a Strategy pattern to route notifications through multiple providers (SendGrid, Twilio, etc.) based on dynamic criteria like cost and reliability.

Design Pattern: Strategy
The Strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

Requirements
Strategy Interface: Define a NotificationStrategy with methods for send(), getCost(), and getReliability().

Provider Implementations: Create concrete strategies for different vendors (e.g., SmsTwilio, EmailSendGrid).

Selector Logic: Implement a ProviderSelector that chooses the best strategy at runtime based on a policy (e.g., "Most Reliable" or "Cheapest").

Failover: If the selected strategy fails, the system should be able to switch to a secondary strategy transparently.

Starter Code
Java

interface NotificationStrategy {
    void send(String message);
    double getCost();
    double getReliability();
}

class NotificationService {
    private ProviderSelector selector;

    public void sendNotification(String msg) {
        // TODO: Use selector to pick the strategy and execute send()
    }
}

// Logic: Picks the cheapest provider with reliability > 95%
class CostOptimizedSelector implements ProviderSelector {
    public NotificationStrategy select(List<NotificationStrategy> providers) {
        // TODO: Filter and Sort logic
        return null; 
    }
}
